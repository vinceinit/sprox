/**
 * Factory for XML processors or builders of XML processors; the main entry point for the Sprox API.
 * <p/>
 * Creating a processor to process XML streams into some type {@code T} consists of the following steps:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Creating an {@link XmlProcessorBuilder} for the type {@code T}, using this {@link XmlProcessorFactory}</li>
 * <li>Configuring the builder, by adding one or more controllers and parsers, the latter being optional</li>
 * <li>Creating an {@link XmlProcessor}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Once an {@link XmlProcessor} has been created, it can be reused over and over again. Sprox itself is thread-safe.
 * Whether an {@link XmlProcessor} is thread-safe however depends on the controllers that you provide.
