/**
 * Declares a namespace. Put a single annotation on a controller class to declare all XML elements used in the
 * controller to belong to that namespace.
 * <p>
 * If a controller handles elements from multiple namespaces, use {@link Namespaces} to list them all.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A namespace has a value - the namespace URI - and a shorthand. This is the name you use in {@link Node},
 * {@link Attribute} and {@link Source} annotations to refer to the namespace by prefixing the name of the element
 * with {@code &lt;shorthand&gt;:}. If a controller uses a single namespace the shorthand can be left empty; there's no
 * need to refer to it anywhere in the class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the namespace shorthand has absolutely nothing to do with namespace prefixes. Prefixes are used within
 * XML documents. Shorthands are used in controller methods. These are different concepts. To drive this point home
 * they are named differently on purpose.
 * </p>
