/**
 * Entry point into Sprox: to create a processor you need a builder and to create a builder, you need this factory.
 * <p>
 * Creating a processor to process XML streams into some type {@code T} consists of the following steps:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Obtaining an instance of this {@link XmlProcessorBuilderFactory}</li>
 * <li>Creating an {@link XmlProcessorBuilder} for the type {@code T}, using the factory</li>
 * <li>Configuring the builder, by adding controllers and parsers, the latter being optional</li>
 * <li>Creating an {@link XmlProcessor}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Once an {@link XmlProcessor} has been created, it can be reused over and over again. Sprox itself is thread-safe.
 * Whether an {@link XmlProcessor} is thread-safe however depends on the controllers that you provide.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this factory is accessible in multiple ways:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>In a plain Java environment: through the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}</li>
 * <li>In a OSGi environment: as an OSGi service.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * As a last resort, you can create an instance of this interface yourself, by instantiating a
 * {@link nl.ulso.sprox.impl.StaxBasedXmlProcessorBuilderFactory}.
 * </p>
